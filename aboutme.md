Hey there! I am Anushree. '{{ :woman_technologist: | emoji}}'

I recently graduated from the [University of British Columbia, Vancouver](https://www.ubc.ca/). During my Master's program, I had the opportunity to work with [Dr.Xiaoxiao Li](https://xxlya.github.io/xiaoxiao/) to develop interpretable [transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)-based models for fMRI analysis. Our work has been selected for poster presentation in the 2023 [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4114) Annual Meeting!

Before moving to Canada, I worked as a software engineer at Robert Bosch and Toshiba. I have a keen interest in the intersection of software engineering and Machine Learning, especially in building responsible AI systems.

Apart from my professional pursuits, I'm a passionate fitness enthusiast. It all started with Zumba â€” I mean, who doesn't love to dance their heart out? I was even a certified zumba instructor! However, along the way, I discovered my true calling lies in strength training and CrossFit. 

Nature also holds a special place in my heart, and I love hiking. The Chadar trek in Leh, India, and the Panorama Ridge hike in Garibaldi Provincial Park are two of my favorite experiences. More details about all my hikes [here](hikes.md).

Thank you for visiting my portfolio page! I'd love to connect and explore potential opportunities or shared interests! Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anushree-bannadabhavi-585435122/) or [email](anushree.bannadabhavi@gmail.com).
