Hi! I am Anushree. '{{ :woman_technologist: | emoji}}'

I recently graduated from the [University of British Columbia, Vancouver](https://www.ubc.ca/). During my Master's program, I worked with [Dr.Xiaoxiao Li](https://xxlya.github.io/xiaoxiao/) to develop interpretable [transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)-based models for fMRI analysis. Our work was selected for poster presentation in the 2023 [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4114) Annual Meeting.

Before I moved to Canada, I was a software engineer at Robert Bosch and Toshiba. I am interested in the intersection of software engineering and Machine Learning and in the development of responsible AI systems.

Alongside my professional pursuits, I am a passionate fitness enthusiast. Although I started my journey with Zumba (even becoming a certified instructor for a year), I have found my true calling in strength training and CrossFit. 

Additionally, I find solace in hiking, with favorites including the thrilling Chadar trek in Leh, India, and the breathtaking Panorama Ridge hike in Garibaldi Provincial Park. More details about all the hikes [here](hikes.md).

Thank you for visiting my portfolio page. I'd love to connect and explore potential opportunities or shared interests! Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anushree-bannadabhavi-585435122/) or [email](anushree.bannadabhavi@gmail.com).
