Apart from my professional pursuits, I'm a passionate fitness enthusiast. It all started with Zumba â€” I mean, who doesn't love to dance their heart out? I was even a certified zumba instructor! However, along the way, I discovered my true calling lies in strength training and CrossFit. 

Nature holds a special place in my heart, and I love hiking. The Chadar trek in Leh, India, and the Panorama Ridge hike in Garibaldi Provincial Park are two of my favorite experiences. More details about all my hikes [here](../hikes/).
