Hey there! I am Anushree :woman_technologist: :smile:

I recently graduated from the [University of British Columbia, Vancouver](https://www.ubc.ca/). During my Master's program, I had the opportunity to work with [Dr.Xiaoxiao Li](https://xxlya.github.io/xiaoxiao/) to develop interpretable [transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)-based models for fMRI analysis. Our paper got accepted in the prestigious [MICCAI](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/) (The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society) 2023 conference and the [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4114) 2023 Annual Meeting!

Before moving to Canada, I worked as a software engineer at Robert Bosch and Toshiba. I have a keen interest in the intersection of software engineering and Machine Learning, with a strong focus on developing responsible AI systems that make a positive impact.
