Hey there! I am Anushree :woman_technologist: :smile:

I am an experienced software engineer and data scientist (5+ years) working in the AI/ML/NLP space.

I currently work at Arteria AI as an NLP Data Scientist and my work revolves around leveraging foundation models and LLMs to extract insights from documents and unstructured data. 

With expertise in software engineering and AI, I'm passionate about integrating these fields to drive innovation and tackle complex real-world problems.


recently graduated from the [University of British Columbia, Vancouver](https://www.ubc.ca/). During my Master's program, I had the opportunity to work with [Dr.Xiaoxiao Li](https://xxlya.github.io/xiaoxiao/) to develop interpretable [transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)-based models for fMRI analysis. Our paper got accepted in the prestigious [MICCAI](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/) (The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society) 2023 conference and the [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4114) 2023 Annual Meeting!
