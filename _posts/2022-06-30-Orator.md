The Student Speaking Simulator creates an immersive room experience using projectors to replicate a live audience, and provides students with the opportunity to practice and develop their speaking skills year-round. The Simulator also records your performance and key metrics, and provides feedback for improvement. Not exclusive to public speaking, the Simulator can be used for interview preparation, boardroom meetings, etc., and reproduce any real world situation. 

I was a part of the initial 3-member team that developed the protoype where I was in-charge of the technical aspects. I developed V1 of the analytics software that provides feedback. I also developed an interactive software that the students used to control the simulator.
