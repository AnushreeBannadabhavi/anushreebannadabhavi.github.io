Built a robocode tank (a Reinforcement Learning agent) that battles with another robot (an enemy) and defeats it ~80% of the time. The error backpropagation algorithm as applied to multi-layer perceptron and reinforcement learning is used for the robotâ€™s attack or defence strategy.

.video-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
}

.video-container video {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;

  height: 100%;
}

### Before training the battle looks something like this:
- Yellow battle tank : Opponent
- Blue battle tank : My battle tank (Not trained)

<div class="video-container">
  <video controls>
    <source src="/assets/img/robocode-before.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

### After training:
- Yellow battle tank : Opponent
- Blue battle tank : My battle tank (Trained)
